# Jose-SM5Utilities

The whole point of this repository is to provide a list of useful ultilities that can be used later on your SM5 themes, stepfiles, programs, or whatever works on those. That's pretty much the whole point.
It'll get updated when I find something I made interesting to add here.

You can contribute adding stuff via Pull Requests, too if you want.
